## Movie Search

This is a simple movie search application that uses a movie API to display movie posters corresponding to your search.
This movie search app uses the The Open Movie Database (OMDB) API, accepting a movie title parameter, to retrieve a poster (from over 280,000 available) of movies relating to your search.
